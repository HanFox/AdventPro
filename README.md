# AdventPro
This is simply a fix for the font by Andreas Kalpakidis. The original font can be found on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Advent+Pro).

All I've done is imported the font to Birdfont and re-exported them. This may mean they are no longer optimized.

# Why?
After using the original font on a client's website I found some kerning issues on the Regular version between Q/U P/. and Q/.

# Update
The font was updated on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Advent+Pro) in December, 2018, but only fixed the issue between Q/U and not P/. and Q/.

# License
This font is available under the [Open Font License](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL_web).

I probably technically breach **PERMISSION & CONDITIONS #3** as I'm using the same "primary font name".

I know that's bad, but I've contacted the font author about this bug before and he didn't seem interested, so a certain level of "well if you don't care, I don't care" occurs.
