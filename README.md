# AdventPro
This is simply a fix for the font by Andreas Kalpakidis that can be found on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Advent+Pro).

All I've done is imported the fonts to Birdfont and re-exported them. They are no longed strictly optimized.

# Why?
After using this on a client's website I found some kerning issues on the Regular version between q/u p/. and q/.

# License
This font is available under the [Open Font License](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL_web)

I probably technically breach **PERMISSION & CONDITIONS #3** as I'm likely using the same "primary font name".

I know that's bad, but I've contacted the Font author about this bug before and he didn't seem interested so a certain level of "well if you don't care, I don't care" occurs.
